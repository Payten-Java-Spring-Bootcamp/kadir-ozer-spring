Imperative Programming as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes how the program executes. Developers are more concerned with how to get an answer step by step. It comprises the sequence of command imperatives. In this, the order of execution is very important and uses both mutable and immutable data.
Declarative Programming as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes what programs to be executed. Developers are more concerned with the answer that is received. It declares what kind of results we want and leave programming language aside focusing on simply figuring out how to produce them. In simple words, it mainly focuses on end result. It expresses the logic of computation.

Indexing is a way to optimize the performance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed. It is a data structure technique which is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database.
The disadvantages of indexes are as follows:
- They decrease performance on inserts, updates, and deletes.
- They take up space (this increases with the number of fields used and the length of the fields).
- Some databases will monocase values in fields that are indexed.

Spring provides @Primary annotation which declares a specific bean as primary, which means primary bean will be given higher preferences when autowiring to a single-valued dependency.

On the other hand, Spring also provides @Qualifier annotation in which the specific bean name is mentioned in its argument. Based on the argument, a specific bean is selected.

Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.

The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:

  - Single Responsibility (a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.)
  - Open/Closed (classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.)
  - Liskov Substitution (if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.)
  - Interface Segregation (larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones.)
  - Dependency Inversion (The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.)

Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format describing REST APIs. The format is both machine-readable and human-readable. As a result, it can be used to share documentation among product managers, testers and developers, but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes.
