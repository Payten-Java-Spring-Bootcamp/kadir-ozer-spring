Spring provides @Primary annotation which declares a specific bean as primary, which means primary bean will be given higher preferences when autowiring to a single-valued dependency.

On the other hand, Spring also provides @Qualifier annotation in which the specific bean name is mentioned in its argument. Based on the argument, a specific bean is selected.

Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.

The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:

  - Single Responsibility (a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.)
  - Open/Closed (classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.)
  - Liskov Substitution (if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.)
  - Interface Segregation (larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones.)
  - Dependency Inversion (The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.)

Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format describing REST APIs. The format is both machine-readable and human-readable. As a result, it can be used to share documentation among product managers, testers and developers, but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes.
